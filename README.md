# Powers Of 2!:
A small clone of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 
The only difference is that sometimes numbers are represented as powers of 2!
Why? Because CS students should know the [powers of 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two) by heart, and if that process could be as addicting as 2048, why not?!
